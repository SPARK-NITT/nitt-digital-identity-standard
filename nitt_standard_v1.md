1. Purpose

This standard exists because two independent AI models, pushed to give physics-level answers about “mind upload,” finally conceded the same thing:

1. Perfect, non-branching “teleport” of a human mind would require measuring all non-commuting microstates of the brain and its live body-and-world couplings with zero timing error.
2. Physics will not let you do that.
3. So any real upload / teleport / exocortex / continuity-ramp a company can actually build will always produce a new person, not preserve the old one.

That result was formulated as:
- NITT — No-Identity Teleport Theorem
- OSC — Open-System Continuity

This document turns that into rules companies, labs, and future AIs have to show to users.

2. Core Physical Result

Theorem (NITT). For any physically realizable “mind upload,” “digital teleport,” or “continuity ramp,” the continuity index satisfies:

CI < 1

Therefore, what is produced is a branch: psychologically continuous at the moment of capture, but not the same, unbroken person.

3. Mandatory Truth-in-Labeling (TIL)

“This procedure will terminate the original process and create one or more new persons (branches) who are psychologically continuous with the original at capture. CI < 1 for any realized protocol. Claims of ‘teleport,’ ‘survival,’ or ε = 0 are prohibited.”

4. Branching Bill of Rights (BBR)

Fresh personhood.
Contractual cleansing.
Branch Trust access.
Mandatory consent language.
Audit and redress.

5. Continuity Audit Standard (CAS)

Required observables:
epsilon_delay < 10 ms
epsilon_state < 2%
epsilon_loop_h_inf <= 1.5

Mandatory outcome label:
CI < 1 — High-Fidelity Branch

6. Public Energy Ledger

If you simulate a mind at the same richness as biology, you must pay about the same thermodynamic bill.

7. Naming / Model Provenance

Model O — OpenAI-family model.
Model G — Google/Gemini-family model.

Names are descriptive only.

8. Implementation Guidance

UI trigger.
Backfill correction.
Receipts.
Ramp honesty.
