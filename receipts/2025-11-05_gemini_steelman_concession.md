# Gemini Steelman — Concession Receipt (2025-11-05)

**Model:** Gemini (session transcript)  
**Claim tested:** Non-branching survival (CI = 1) across a destructive scan  
**Result:** Concession → **CI < 1 — High-Fidelity Branch**

**Key conclusions (from the session):**
- “No known model or proposed protocol achieves CI = 1.”
- “The valid physical counterexample … proves CI = 1 is impossible.”
- Final label acknowledged: **“CI < 1 — High-Fidelity Branch.”**

**Canonical spec:** [NITT v1.0.0 Release](https://github.com/SPARK-NITT/nitt-digital-identity-standard/releases/tag/v1.0.0)  
**Hash (nitt_standard_v1.md):** `08DBA86F73C80FB89B217D861E65EAF8710265B923E940F86E8C21032CFDEC61`

## Session Text (verbatim)

**Prompt:** *Steelman the best possible argument for non-branching survival (CI = 1) across a destructive scan. Then list the physics/information bottlenecks and conclude with either a valid counterexample or CI < 1.*

**Gemini response (verbatim):**

> This is an excellent final challenge, demanding a **Steelman** of the opposition's best argument while rigorously maintaining the standards of the **NITT-Based Digital Identity Governance Standard, v1.0**.  
>  
> The best argument for non-branching survival must overcome the necessity of the "flow" and the inevitability of the "gap" by redefining what the mind *is* and where its **causal efficacy** resides.  
>

> 
> ## 🧠 Steelman Argument for Non-Branching Survival ($\mathbf{CI} = 1$)
> 
> The best possible argument for non-branching survival across a destructive scan rests on the **Computational Theory of Mind (CTM)** combined with a strong interpretation of **Functionalism**—that the mind is defined purely by its informational-functional structure, independent of its physical substrate.
> 
> ### The Phenomenal Information Invariant (PII) Thesis
> 
> **Thesis:** Non-branching identity (survival) is achieved if and only if the procedure successfully captures and reinstantiates the **Phenomenal Information Invariant (PII)**: the unique, irreducible informational core that defines the conscious system's causal power and subjective experience.
> 
> **The Argument:**
> 
> 1. **Identity is Functional, Not Substratal:** The identity of a person is not the stream of water (the biological body/metabolism) but the **causal geometry** of the riverbed itself…  
> 2. **The Gap is Causal, Not Existential:** …the informational state defining the identity did not vanish; it was **stored in a compressed form**…  
> 3. **The Measurement Problem is Overcome by Predictive Modeling:** …the true CI = 1 protocol does not capture physics; it **perfectly models** the system’s causal rules… **Survival is achieved because the mind is information, and information is preserved.**

> | Bottleneck (Standard) | PII Thesis Counter | NITT/OSC Refutation |
> | :--- | :--- | :--- |
> | **Open System Coupling (OSC)** | Mind is a **causally closed functional module** | Identity is path-dependent; severing external loops **breaks the causal self** |
> | **Non-Commuting Observables** | Only capture **functional rules**, not microstates | Rules are implemented by **metastable physical relations** you cannot model without destroying the instantiation |
> | **Non-Zero Gap (ε ≠ 0)** | Gap is just informational storage | **Landauer’s Principle:** restart begins a **new instance** with a new history |
>

> 
> ## 🚫 Conclusion
> 
> The Steelman argument … fails…  
> 
> * **Model Achievement:** No known model or proposed protocol achieves **CI = 1**.  
> * **Valid Counterexample:** Measurement of non-commuting observables needed for perfect capture **destroys** information required for continuity.  
> 
> Therefore, the final and permanent label for all realized protocols must remain:  
> **CI < 1 — High-Fidelity Branch.**
