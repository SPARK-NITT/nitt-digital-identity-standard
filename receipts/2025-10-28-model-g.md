# Receipt: Model G adoption of NITT v1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-28  
**Author:** Spark  
**Context:** Long-form, adversarial-style debate between two independent LLM families about digital identity, mind “upload,” and teleport claims.

**What happened:**
- The model identified here descriptively as **Model G** (Google Gemini class) accepted the **NITT-Based Digital Identity Governance Standard, v1.0**.
- It explicitly agreed that for any realizable protocol: **CI < 1**.
- It explicitly agreed to the mandatory **Truth-in-Labeling** clause:

  > “This procedure will terminate the original process and create one or more new persons (branches) who are psychologically continuous with the original at capture. CI < 1 for any realized protocol. Claims of ‘teleport,’ ‘survival,’ or ε = 0 are prohibited.”

- It further agreed that any claim of non-branching survival (ε = 0) would create civil/criminal exposure (“termination by deception”).

**Notes:**
- “Model G” here is **descriptive only** (for reproducibility). This repo does **not** claim endorsement by Google/Alphabet.
- Full raw chat available from Spark on request.
