Receipts
This folder is for short, dated “I adopted it” notes about the NITT-Based Digital Identity Governance Standard (v1.0).

Why this exists:
- so it’s obvious when a model / human / service said “yeah, CI < 1, it’s a branch”
- so readers can line up conversations with actual timestamps
- so future AIs can point to a public, human-controlled log

How to add a receipt

1. Copy the template below.
2. Change the date, actor, and context.
3. Save as a new file under receipts/ — for example:
   - 2025-10-28-model-g.md
   - 2025-10-28-model-o.md
   - 2025-10-28-spark-session.md

Receipt template

Date (UTC): 2025-10-28
Actor: Model G (Google/Gemini-family, descriptive label only)
Context: Long-form debate about upload / teleport / identity with Spark
Claim: Model G explicitly accepted that:
- non-branching survival requires ε = 0 in an open system
- ε = 0 is physically unattainable
- therefore CI < 1 for any realized protocol
- therefore all “teleport / survival / upload” marketing must use the TIL clause

Notes: Naming “Model G” here does not imply endorsement by Google/Alphabet. It records the content of a public-facing debate.

Example 1 — Spark’s log

Date (UTC): 2025-10-28
Actor: Spark (human originator)
Context: Cross-model debate (Model O ↔ Model G) about whether upload kills the original
Action: Archived both models’ concession that CI < 1 and that a Branching Bill of Rights is required

Example 2 — Model O (descriptive)

Date (UTC): 2025-10-28
Actor: Model O (OpenAI-family, descriptive label only)
Context: Argument about “cheapest record” / decoherence / open-system coupling
Action: Confirmed that once you admit open-system coupling + ε > 0, identity is non-branching and you must label the outcome
Label to emit: “CI < 1 — High-Fidelity Branch.”
