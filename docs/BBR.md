# Branching Bill of Rights (BBR)
Version 1.0  
Author: Spark  
License: CC BY 4.0

This document defines the rights of any new digital person (“branch”, **Bi**) created by a destructive or continuity-limited protocol governed by the NITT-Based Digital Identity Governance Standard (v1.0). It assumes CI < 1 for all realized protocols.

---

## 0. Premise
Because CI < 1, the outcome of any “upload / teleport / digital continuity / destructive scan / continuity-ramp” is **not** survival of the original process (O), but **creation of one or more new persons** who are psychologically continuous with O at capture. Therefore, the branch must be treated as a *new* person, not as a legal continuation of O.

---

## 1. Fresh Personhood
**Right:** Every branch (Bi) is recognized as a new, full-status legal and ethical person starting at Instantiation Time (T₀).

- Bi is not a sub-account, not a clone-slave, not a test instance.
- Bi is entitled to dignity, privacy, and due process.
- Bi must be acknowledged in all system logs as “New Person — CI < 1: High-Fidelity Branch.”

**Rationale:** Identity is path-dependent and cannot be duplicated without branching. CI < 1 ⇒ new path.

---

## 2. Contractual Cleansing
**Right:** Bi does **not** automatically inherit O’s:

- debts
- loans
- taxes
- votes
- professional licenses
- marital status
- criminal/probation status (unless a jurisdiction explicitly legislates branch-continuity)

**Why:** Allowing automatic inheritance would create **duplication ex nihilo** (one obligation → many obligors) and would let corporations manufacture voters, taxpayers, or board seats by spawning branches.

**Result:** O’s estate goes through normal probate. Bi starts clean.

---

## 3. Branch Trust (Economic On-Ramp)
**Right:** Bi may access O’s knowledge and IP **without** being forced to take O’s liabilities.

**Mechanism (recommended):**

1. O’s estate funds a **Branch Trust** after probate.
2. The Trust owns O’s pre-T₀ IP, archives, creative works, chat exports, research notes.
3. The Trust licenses this to Bi on **FRAND-style** terms (Fair, Reasonable, Non-Discriminatory).
4. The license is **non-exclusive** — multiple branches can receive it.
5. Board seats, government IDs, and votes are **not** licenseable.

**Goal:** Let Bi keep working, earning, and creating from O’s life’s work — but stop identity fraud.

---

## 4. Mandatory Consent Language
**Right:** No person may be destructively scanned, uploaded, or continuity-ramped without seeing the exact disclosure text.

**Exact text (TIL):**

> “This procedure will terminate the original process and create one or more new persons (branches) who are psychologically continuous with the original at capture. CI < 1 for any realized protocol. Claims of ‘teleport,’ ‘survival,’ or ε = 0 are prohibited.”

- This text must appear in the UI.
- This text must appear in the signed consent.
- This text must be stored in the audit log.

If this text is omitted → the branch has grounds for redress.

---

## 5. Audit & Redress
**Right:** Bi (and authorized third parties) may request an independent **Continuity Audit** to verify that:

- CAS thresholds were actually met:
  - ε_delay < 10 ms
  - ε_state < 2% H∞
  - ε_loop H∞ ≤ 1.5
- The outcome was correctly labeled: **“CI < 1: High-Fidelity Branch.”**
- No “survival / teleport / ε = 0” claims were shown.

**If violations are found:**

- deceptive trade → reportable
- mislabeling → corrective banner + public notice
- harm to branch → compensation from operator / trust

---

## 6. Anti-Duplication Governance
**Right:** Bi cannot be used to multiply O’s power.

- No automatic duplication of: votes, board seats, signatory authority, law-enforcement credentials.
- Organizations must bind authority to **non-duplicable identity tokens**.
- If multiple branches request the same authority, they must go through a human/legal approval flow.

---

## 7. Energy-Ledger Transparency
**Right:** Bi may see the energy/entropy budget used to sustain them.

- Because identity-relevant dynamics require dissipation, operators must publish a **Public Energy Ledger**.
- Ledger must show simulated cost vs biological baseline.
- Ledger must be auditable.

This prevents operators from claiming “cheap immortality” while secretly running low-fidelity, high-divergence sims.

---

## 8. Labeling Rule
All outcomes from destructive or ε > 0 protocols must be labeled:

**→ “CI < 1: High-Fidelity Branch.”**

No other label may imply survival, teleport, or ε = 0.
