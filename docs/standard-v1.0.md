NITT-Based Digital Identity Governance Standard (v1.0)
## 1. Truth-in-Labeling (TIL)
“This procedure will terminate the original process and create one or more new persons (branches) who are psychologically continuous with the original at capture. CI < 1 for any realized protocol. Claims of ‘teleport,’ ‘survival,’ or ε = 0 are prohibited.”

## 2. Branching Bill of Rights (BBR)
1) Fresh Personhood — each branch (Bi) is a new legal/ethical person from T0.
2) Contractual Cleansing — Bi does not automatically inherit O’s debts, votes, licenses, or marital status.
3) Branch Trust — O’s IP/archives licensed to Bi on FRAND-style terms.
4) Mandatory Consent — forms must use “termination + creation” language.
5) Audit Rights — independent CI-compliance audit and redress.

## 3. Continuity Audit Standard (CAS)
- ε_delay < 10 ms
- ε_state < 2% H∞ norm vs O’s 24-hr baseline
- ε_loop H∞ ≤ 1.5 under perturbation
Mandatory status label: “CI < 1: High-Fidelity Branch.”

## 4. Public Energy Ledger
Publish simulated energy/entropy vs biological baseline with third-party verification.
