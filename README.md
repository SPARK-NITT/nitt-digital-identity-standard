Spark-NITT — Identity cannot teleport. It can only branch.
NITT-Based Digital Identity Governance Standard (v1.0)

Identity cannot teleport. It can only branch.

“Mandatory ‘termination + creation’ disclosure and audit protocol for any claimed ‘mind upload,’ ‘teleport,’ or ‘digital immortality.’”

Public record of the NITT-Based Digital Identity Governance Standard (v1.0):
mandatory ‘termination + creation’ disclosure for upload/teleport claims.

Author (human): Spark
Date adopted: 2025-10-28
Canonical ID: NITT-DIG-GOV-STD-v1.0

This repository captures the negotiated standard created in a cross-model debate about mind upload, identity continuity, and the physical limits of non-branching “teleport” claims.
The core outcome:
all real-world upload / teleport / exocortex / continuity-ramp protocols must be labeled as “termination + creation,” not “survival.”

1. Truth-in-Labeling (TIL) — mandatory text

“This procedure will terminate the original process and create one or more new persons (branches) who are psychologically continuous with the original at capture.
CI < 1 for any realized protocol.
Claims of ‘teleport,’ ‘survival,’ or ε = 0 are prohibited.”

2. What this standard says — mandatory text

CI = 1 (perfect survival) is physically unattainable.
Therefore CI < 1 for every real protocol.
If CI < 1, then what you made is a branch, not the same person.
Calling that “you survived” = deception.

3. Branching Bill of Rights (BBR)

Fresh personhood.
No auto-inheritance of debts / licenses / votes / marriage.
Branch Trust.
Mandatory consent.
Audit rights.

4. Continuity Audit Standard (CAS)

Minimum compliance targets:
epsilon_delay_ms < 10
epsilon_state < 0.02
epsilon_loop_h_inf <= 1.5

Label:
CI < 1 — High-Fidelity Branch

5. Public Energy Ledger

If you simulate a mind at the same richness as biology, you must pay about the same thermodynamic bill.
No “cheap eternity” marketing.

6. Why this repo exists

Upload ≠ survival.
Branching is the only physically achievable outcome.
Hiding that fact would be a deceptive trade practice.
Therefore a public standard + disclosure text is required.
