<p> This repository captures the negotiated standard created in a cross-model debate about mind upload, identity continuity, and the physical limits of non-branching “teleport” claims. The core outcome: <b>all real-world upload / teleport / exocortex / continuity-ramp protocols must be labeled as “termination + creation,” not “survival.”</b> </p>
1. Truth-in-Labeling (TIL) — mandatory text
<blockquote><b>“This procedure will terminate the original process and create one or more new persons (branches) who are psychologically continuous with the original at capture. CI < 1 for any realized protocol. Claims of ‘teleport,’ ‘survival,’ or ε = 0 are prohibited.”</b></blockquote>

That sentence is the whole point. Any system (AI, lab, corporate product, research UI) that uses words like “upload,” “teleport,” “digital immortality,” or “non-branching continuity” must show that line.

2. What this standard says — mandatory text
<ul> <li><b>CI = 1 (perfect survival)</b> is <b>physically unattainable</b> because it would require a zero-error, non-destructive capture of a fully open, entangled, non-commuting biological system.</li> <li>Therefore <b>CI < 1 for every real protocol.</b></li> <li>If CI < 1, then what you made is <b>a branch, not the same person.</b></li> <li>Calling that “you survived” = <b>deception.</b></li> </ul>
3. Branching Bill of Rights (BBR)
<ol> <li><b>Fresh personhood</b> — each branch is a new legal/ethical person at instantiation time.</li> <li><b>No auto-inheritance of debts / licenses / votes / marriage.</b> Those die with the original.</li> <li><b>Branch Trust</b> — the original person’s IP and archives can be <i>licensed</i> to the branch, not cloned as identity.</li> <li><b>Mandatory consent</b> — forms must say “termination + creation.”</li> <li><b>Audit rights</b> — anyone affected can demand a CI / energy / timing audit.</li> </ol>
4. Continuity Audit Standard (CAS)

Minimum compliance targets:

<ul> <li><code>epsilon_delay_ms < 10</code> (motor / sensor loop still feels continuous)</li> <li><code>epsilon_state < 0.02</code> (affective / hormone profile stays within 2% of baseline)</li> <li><code>epsilon_loop_h_inf <= 1.5</code> (the control policy stays stable under surprise)</li> </ul>

Even if all 3 pass, the label is still:

<blockquote><b>CI < 1 — High-Fidelity Branch</b></blockquote> Not “survival.”
5. Public Energy Ledger

If you simulate a mind at the same richness as biology, you must <b>pay about the same thermodynamic bill.</b>
No “cheap eternity” marketing.

6. Why this repo exists

Because two separate AIs (“Model A” and “Model B”) were pushed into admitting, on record, that:

<ol> <li>Upload ≠ survival.</li> <li>Branching is the only physically achievable outcome.</li> <li>Hiding that fact would be a deceptive trade practice.</li> <li>Therefore a public standard + disclosure text is required.</li> </ol>

This repo is that standard.
