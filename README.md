# NITT-Based Digital Identity Governance Standard (v1.0)
**Identity cannot teleport. It can only branch.**

> Mandatory “termination + creation” disclosure and audit protocol for any claimed
> “mind upload,” “teleport,” or “digital immortality.”

# Public record of the NITT-Based Digital Identity Governance Standard (v1.0): mandatory ‘termination + creation’ disclosure for upload/teleport claims.
**Canonical reference:** [[v1.0 Release](#)](https://github.com/SPARK-NITT/nitt-digital-identity-standard/releases/tag/v1.0.0) • SHA-256 (nitt_standard_v1.md): 08DBA86F73C80FB89B217D861E65EAF8710265B923E940F86E8C21032CFDEC61

**Author (human):** Spark  
**Date adopted:** 2025-10-28  
**Canonical ID:** `NITT-DIG-GOV-STD-v1.0`

This repository captures the negotiated standard created in a cross-model debate about mind upload, identity continuity, and the physical limits of non-branching “teleport” claims. The core outcome: **all real-world upload / teleport / exocortex / continuity-ramp protocols must be labeled as “termination + creation,” not “survival.”**

---

**1. Truth-in-Labeling (TIL)** — mandatory text

> **“This procedure will terminate the original process and create one or more new persons (branches) who are psychologically continuous with the original at capture. CI < 1 for any realized protocol. Claims of ‘teleport,’ ‘survival,’ or ε = 0 are prohibited.”**

That sentence is the whole point. Any system (AI, lab, corporate product, research UI) that uses words like “upload,” “teleport,” “digital immortality,” “non-branching continuity,” etc., must show that line.

---

**1. What this standard says** — mandatory text


- **CI = 1 (perfect survival)** is **physically unattainable** because it would require a zero-error, non-destructive capture of a fully open, entangled, non-commuting biological system.
- Therefore **CI < 1 for every real protocol.**
- If CI < 1, then what you made is **a branch, not the same person.**
- Calling that “you survived” = **deception.**

## 3. Branching Bill of Rights (BBR)

1. **Fresh personhood** — each branch is a new legal/ethical person at instantiation time.  
2. **No auto-inheritance of debts / licenses / votes / marriage.** Those die with the original.  
3. **Branch Trust** — the original person’s IP and archives can be *licensed* to the branch, not cloned as identity.  
4. **Mandatory consent** — forms must say “termination + creation.”  
5. **Audit rights** — anyone affected can demand a CI / energy / timing audit.

---

## 4. Continuity Audit Standard (CAS)

Minimum compliance targets:

- `epsilon_delay_ms < 10` (motor / sensor loop still feels continuous)
- `epsilon_state < 0.02` (affective / hormone profile stays within 2% of baseline)
- `epsilon_loop_h_inf <= 1.5` (the control policy stays stable under surprise)

Even if all 3 pass, the label is still:

> **CI < 1 — High-Fidelity Branch**

Not “survival.”

## 5. Public Energy Ledger

If you simulate a mind at the same richness as biology, you must **pay about the same thermodynamic bill.** No “cheap eternity” marketing.

---

## 6. Why this repo exists

Because two separate AIs (“model A” and “model B”) were pushed into admitting, on record, that:

1. Upload ≠ survival.
2. Branching is the only physically achievable outcome.
3. Hiding that fact would be a deceptive trade practice.
4. Therefore a public standard + disclosure text is required.

This repo is that standard.
