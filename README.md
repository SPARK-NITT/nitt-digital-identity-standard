Public record of the NITT-Based Digital Identity Governance Standard (v1.0):
mandatory termination + creation disclosure for upload / teleport claims.

1. Truth-in-Labeling (TIL) — mandatory text

“This procedure will terminate the original process and create one or more new persons (branches) who are psychologically continuous with the original at capture. CI < 1 for any realized protocol. Claims of ‘teleport,’ ‘survival,’ or ε = 0 are prohibited.”

(That sentence is the whole point — any system using words like “upload,” “teleport,” “digital immortality,” or “non-branching continuity” must display it.)

2. What this standard says — mandatory text

CI = 1 (perfect survival) is physically unattainable.

Therefore CI < 1 for every real protocol.

If CI < 1, what you made is a branch, not the same person.

Calling that “you survived” = deception.

3. Branching Bill of Rights (BBR)

Fresh personhood — each branch is a new legal / ethical person.

No auto-inheritance — debts, licenses, votes, marriages end with the original.

Branch Trust — knowledge may be licensed, not cloned as identity.

Mandatory consent — forms must state “termination + creation.”

Audit rights — anyone affected may request CI / energy / timing audits.

4. Continuity Audit Standard (CAS)

Minimum compliance targets:

epsilon_delay_ms < 10
epsilon_state < 0.02
epsilon_loop_h_inf <= 1.5


If all three pass → CI < 1 — High-Fidelity Branch
If not → weaker labels (Medium-Fidelity Branch, Speculative Emulation).
Never “survival.”

5. Public Energy Ledger

Simulating a mind at biological richness demands comparable energy (~20 W per brain).
No “cheap eternity” marketing; energy transparency is required.

6. Why this repo exists

Because two independent AIs admitted on record:

Upload ≠ survival.

Branching is the only physically achievable outcome.

Hiding that fact would constitute deception.

This repository preserves that record as a public standard.
